TTTH prog.
### TTTH - what is it?
 TTTH (Throw to the horizon) program - is a small scientific program that allows you to solve and visualize some problems - "throw at angle to the horizon".

***

### From the point of view of the language
 The program is still being developed, so I will not cite all its technical capabilities, I will only say what we were based on.
 Here are our friends in this program:
* PyQt5
* PyQtGraph
* And some math repositories
 
Also, several libraries for processing output to the terminal:

* colorama
* prettytable


***

### So, what exactly can the program do?
* Find unknown physical quantities from known
* Display the flight of the object in real time (on the graph)
* Generate additional logs with all possible information of the task
* The ability to select "customization packages" (different planets and objects with different characteristics), and create your own.

During the development, we will implement these capabilities of the program. And then, after the first release, there will be technical documentation for all files and most functions.
